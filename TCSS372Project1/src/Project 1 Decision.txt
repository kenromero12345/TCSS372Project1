1) Assembly language level
2) token delimeters - space **separate each instruction by line ***maybe throw exception if they don't do it
3) input to the simulator - JtxtArea
4) Memory increment by 1, start at 0, end at 49(including), use GUI to visualize
5) Registers 32, use GUI to visualize
6) GUI
7) Execute all
