Project Decisions

1) We will use assembly language level.
2) Token delimeters: we will separate each instruction by a line break, we will separate the operator
   and the operand with a space, and we will separate operands through commas.
3) We will use a JTextArea to capture the instructions from the user.
4) The memory will increment by 4. Our simulator will have 100 memory spaces, with 0-49 being for the
   data and 50-99 being for the stack. We will use the GUI to visualize the memory.
5) We will have 32 registers, and use the GUI to visualize the registers.
6) We will have a graphical user interface that the user can interact with. We will have buttons that
   will allow the user to assemble the program, execute one line, and execute all lines.
7) The user has the option of executing one line, or all lines.

----
Opcode should be all capital letters. ex. ADD, ADDI 
Registers are with $ ex. %t0, %zero
Constant is from -2^15 to 2^15 - 1
Format of the instruction is the following:
	R-format
	<opcode> <register>,<register>,<register> ex. ADD $zero,$t0,$a0
	I-format except LW, SW, BEQ, BNE
	<opcode> <register>,<register>,<constant>
	LW, SW
	
	BEQ, BNE
	
	J
	
	JR
